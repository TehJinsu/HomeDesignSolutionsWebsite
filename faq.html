        <h1 class="text-bodylarge"> Home Design Solutions Frequently Asked Questions </h1>
        <details>
        <summary class="text-bodymed"> How much will my cabinets cost? </summary>

        <p class="text-bodysmall">Cabinets vary dramatically in price just like cars or houses. Entry-level cabinets are
            less expensive than
            cabinets with special finishes and upgraded storage features. HDS provides cabinetry that fits most any
            budget—from basic to bold. </p>
        </details>

        <details>
        <summary class="text-bodymed">How long will it take to get the cabinets I order?</summary>

        <p class="text-bodysmall">Order time varies depending on the manufacturer and the complexity of the job. The
            minimum time is
            roughly three weeks and can be as much as eight weeks during peak times of the year.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
        <summary class="text-bodymed">Can you design my kitchen from a sketch of the room that I provide?</summary>

        <p class="text-bodysmall">We can certainly start with a sketch you provide. Your forethought in doing some
            homework can shorten
            the time needed to design the final layout. However, we will always do our own measurements to verify
            that the design will actually work.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
        <summary class="text-bodymed">What is the best type of countertop for the kitchen?</summary>

        <p class="text-bodysmall">There are many possible countertop choices. As with cabinets, your budget needs to be
            matched with
            your desire for flexibility of design and product longevity. Laminate, solid surface, quartz-enhanced and
            granite are all good choices.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
        <summary class="text-bodymed">Can you match my existing cabinets or furniture?</summary>

        <p class="text-bodysmall">All woods and stains change color over time—some more so than others. In many cases,
            HDS can find
            cabinetry that may be compatible with your existing cabinets or furniture. In no case can we guarantee
            an exact match.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
        <summary class="text-bodymed">What construction features should I look for when choosing cabinets?</summary>

        <p class="text-bodysmall">Certain construction features are a sign of quality cabinets. A savvy consumer will
            look for things such as
            finished backs in all cabinets, drawer guides that also support the drawer bottom, conversion varnish (not
            lacquer) finishes, multi-way adjustable hinges, adjustable shelves, and a wide range of heights and
            depths. Newer convenience features include “soft-close” hinges and drawers, multi-function drawer
            systems, and optional task lighting.</p>
        
        <p class="text-bodysmall">Be sure to check for the KCMA (Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association) label, a
            certification that the
            cabinets meet construction standards designed to ensure many years of trouble-free service.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
        <summary class="text-bodymed">What are the most popular types of cabinets?</summary>

        <p class="text-bodysmall">While popular cabinet styles and trends vary from year to year, traditional
            raised-panel oak styling is
            always a favorite due to affordability and durability. A current trend is a “stand-alone” furniture look
            that
            allows for highly customized design features using cabinetry from major manufacturers.
            Besides oak, certain wood species tend to be favored by today's consumers. Maple is frequently used in
            remodeling because of its clean look and its ability to blend in with most existing finishes. Cherry has
            become increasingly popular as manufacturers have developed a variety of finishes allowing it to work in
            more applications.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
        <summary class="text-bodymed">Are environmentally “green” cabinets available at a reasonable price? </summary>

        <p class="text-bodysmall">HDS represents several manufacturers across the price spectrum whose cabinets are
            certified under the
            Environmental Stewardship Program developed by the KCMA (Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers
            Association).</p>
        </details>

        <details>
        <summary class="text-bodymed">What's the difference between manufactured cabinets and custom-made cabinets?</summary>

        <p class="text-bodysmall">Years ago there was a significant difference in the sizes and finishes available from
            "custom"
            cabinetmakers and the "stock" manufacturers. Today, many cabinet manufacturers offer custom sizing
            and finishes that rival, and may even exceed, the possibilities of a local custom cabinet shop. </p>
        </details>

        <details>
        <summary class="text-bodymed">Do you charge a design fee, measure fee or other fees in addition to the contract price
            for cabinets and installation?</summary>

        <p class="text-bodysmall">HDS does not charge a measure fee or a design fee for a first design or estimate. In
            some cases, where
            multiple design revisions are requested, a design retainer may be requested. That retainer is then
            credited in full to the final cost of the job.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
        <summary class="text-bodymed">Do you do major remodeling? </summary>

        <p class="text-bodysmall">HDS specializes in "light" kitchen, office, or laundry room remodeling. We have strong
            working
            relationships with several quality, full-line remodeling firms for those jobs that require major structural
            renovation.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
        <summary class="text-bodymed">Do you provide cabinets for remodeling only, or also for new construction?</summary>

        <p class="text-bodysmall">HDS works with a number of reputable remodelers and can provide cabinets through your
            contractor or
            directly to you for your kitchen or bath remodeling project or room addition. We also work with many
            custom home builders, who consult with our designers to assure that the layouts for kitchen cabinets,
            bath cabinets, laundry room cabinets and other cabinetry are chosen to properly fit the budget and space.
            We will coordinate directly with your builder and also consult directly with youbecome increasingly popular
            as manufacturers have developed a variety of finishes allowing it to work in
            more applications.</p>
